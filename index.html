<h2>THE EAGLE AND THE CROW</h2>

<p>The wise well know their force to weigh,
Nor what they cannot do, essay.
A carrion crow an eagle saw
Seize on a lamb with beak and claw.
Conceiving he could better do,
He pounces on a well fed ewe;
But he and not the sheep was caught;
For when to fly with it he sought,
His feet entangled in the wool,
The shepherd seiz’d the helpless fool.</p>

<h3>THE MAN AND THE SERPENT</h3>

<p1>There’s in the world a cursed race,
Of nature so perverse and base,
If from the gallows you should save,
A dangerous enemy you have.
A countryman a serpent found,
Stiffen’d with frost upon the ground,
And took her home; but when the fire
Began new vigor to inspire,
Swelling her neck with angry eyes,
She fills the cot with hissing cries.
The rustic then his axe did take,
«Is this then the return you make?
Is this your gratitude?» he said,
And knock’d the reptile on the head.</p1>

      <h4>THE SWALLOW AND THE BIRDS</h4>
      <p2>Those who of guides stand most in need,
Are least inclin’d advice to heed.
A travell’d swallow, learn’d and wise,
To all his feather’d neighbors cries:
«See you yon laborers there below;
What is it, think ye, that they sow?
‘Tis hemp, my friends; of which are made
The nets that for us all are laid;
The moment yonder men are gone,
Then pick the seeds up one by one.»
The gay inhabitants of air
For his precaution little care.
The seedling sprung; again the swallow
Urges his good advice to follow;
Again his counsel they deride.
The plants full grown, and cut, and dried,
Beaten and spun, the nets were made,
And the unwary birds betray’d,
Regretting, in their hapless fate,
Their incredulity too late.
Learn hence the danger to foresee,
Nor wait for their maturity.</2p>
